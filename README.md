# Hash Table Implementation

This repository contains the implementation of a hash table using two different collision resolution strategies: Separate Chaining and Open Addressing.

## Separate Chaining

In the Separate Chaining method, each element in the hash table array is a linked list. All elements that hash to the same index are placed in the same linked list.
